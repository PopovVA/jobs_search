# jobs_search

Pjocets was created for demonstrate how working HeadHunter API, SuperJob API.

## How it works

1. Python3 should be already installed. Then use ```pip``` (or ```pip3```, if there is a conflict with Python2) to install dependencies:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Environment keys should be in ```.env``` file, he should contains one variable, it's a secret token from super job, you should get him from this link [SuperJob](https://api.superjob.ru/register)
```
SecretKey=your secret key from super job
```

3. Now we can run the code
```
$ python3 main.py
```

## Project goals

The code is written for educational purposes on online-course for web-developers [dvmn.org](https://dvmn.org).
